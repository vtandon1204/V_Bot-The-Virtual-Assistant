## ✨ Key Features

- 🎤 **Speech Recognition**: Understands your voice commands using the powerful `speech_recognition` library.
- 🧠 **NLP-Powered**: Built with `nltk` for efficient natural language processing.
- 🛠 **Automation**: Opens websites, fetches information, and performs small tasks like a pro.
- 🔧 **Custom Commands**: Easily extend the assistant by adding your own commands.

---

## 💻 How it Works
1. **Start V_Bot**: After running `python main.py`, the assistant will activate and start listening for your voice commands.

2. **Interact**: You can ask questions or give commands such as:

  - “What's the weather today?”
  - “Open YouTube.”
  - “Tell me a joke.”
3. **Stop the Bot**: Just say “exit” or “quit” to gracefully stop the assistant.
